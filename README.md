## 🎯 Cybersecurity Focused | Offensive Security Learner | Top 1% Mixing Engineer

Hi there, I’m Steve aka HckCrk 👋.  I'm a high-performance creative professional turned cybersecurity practitioner. I’m building deep expertise in offensive security, penetration testing, and red teaming. My GitHub is home to my hands-on learning journey, homelab builds, tooling experiments, writeups, and notes from platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and PentesterLab.

### 🔐 Currently exploring:

- Vulnerability discovery & exploitation techniques
- Linux and macOS hardening and hacking
- Bash/Python scripting for recon and automation
- WebApp hacking: Web fuzzing, API enumeration, network mapping, and more
- Protocols; AI, web, and wireless
- Hacking Windows and Azure Active Directory/Microsoft Entra ID

🧠 I thrive at the intersection of creativity and problem-solving. You can follow my progress and articles over at my [GitHub Pages blog](https://hckcrk.github.io) 

**Let’s break things and build better defenses.**
